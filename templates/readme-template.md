## About

The Good Project Readme Project is a project about about how to make a good Readme so that you can keep your projects well documented and allow yourself and others to build on or learn from your work. The project is meant to be an example for others to learn by example and see what aspects might be necessary for a good readme.


<!-- It is essential to describe how to set up your project -->
## Setup

<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
### Prerequisites

To make a good readme the following prerequisites are necessary:
1. A text editor - preferably [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. An understanding of markdown syntax. You can learn about markdown at this [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
3. Tender love and care - writing good, clear, and kind documentation takes a lot of work, but you (and your contributors) will appreciate you. 

<!-- any installation needs should be defined -->
### Installation

For this particular project, there are no specific installation requirements, however you might look at some open source projects for inspiration about how to write good installation notes. You can see one example in this [Installing Node.js Guide](../guides/installing-nodejs.md).
